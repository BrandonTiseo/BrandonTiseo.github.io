            <img src="./images/pinterest.png" alt="the pinterest logo">
            <h3><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">pinterest.com</a></h3>
            <p>Pinterest is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="website-heading">Contrast:</h4>
                    <p>Pinterest successfully fulfills the contrast design principle as it has an all white background with black and red, which easily stand out on the white background, as its two primary colors for icons and text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="website-heading">Repetition:</h4>
                    <p>Pinterest successfully fulfills the repetition design principle. Each page contains consistant headers and footers for ease-of-use and familiarity. Furthermore, every page, regardless of its purpose, follows a similar design principle with everything being contained within rounded squares.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="website-heading">Alignment:</h4>
                    <p>Pinterest successfully fulfills the alignment design principle. All items on the page align vertically with each other. Furthermore, the image containers, regardless of their varying shapes and content, all stay relatively aligned with one another, keeping the design clean.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="website-heading">Proximity:</h4>
                    <p>Pinterest successfully fulfills the proximity design principle. No element on the page is right up against one another and there it consistant margins and padding around each one.</p>
                </li>
